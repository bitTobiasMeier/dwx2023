# Dinner.API
Sample backend application for the presentation "Effective Development with TypeScript" at the Developer Week 2023 in Nuremberg.


## Start
Please open the solution e.g. with Visual Studio and start the application.

## Understand this sample

The application contains two controllers, a RestaurantController, which returns a list of restaurants, and a ReservationController. The ReservationController does not persist the reservations, because the example should be as simple as possible.
